Title: Can (Generative Pretrained ) Transformers Save Us?

Auther: Anton Gorov

## Abstract

## Methods

To measure the performance of the AI(GPT-4o) we hand crafted test to measure 3 different components that may influence the performance of the AI.

1. Snippet length - How much context does the AI recive. Does more code increase the accuracy, or make it harder to identify the problem.
2. Descriptiveness - How well the code is documented (naming, comments, etc.)
3. Specificity - How specific the subject is. Some code is more generic than other, Quick sort in C is much more common that quick sort in Fortran.

The test examples will be categorized in accordence to the 3 critiria above. For example, **(long,obfuscated,specific)** means that the AI was given a long, non-descriptive code of an uncommon task.
